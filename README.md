## Advanced Features
### This project highlights the price differences in childcare between type of care (in-home vs center-based) and the geographic disparities in costs. It looks at childcare costs in the United States over the course of 4 years (2014-2018). The project used random forest modeling to predict childcare costs. It uses a chloropleth map and tables to help visualize the geographic disparities in childcare costs.
