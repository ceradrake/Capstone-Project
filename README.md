#### This project examines the cost of childcare across the United States using data from the National Database of Childcare Prices, the most comprehensive federal source available. It focuses on average weekly costs for both in-home and center-based care. On average, center-based care was found to be more expensive than in-home care across most states.A machine learning model was developed, trained, and tested to predict average weekly childcare costs by state. The model performed well, achieving a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 28.51, with prediction errors centered around zero. In addition to predictive modeling, the project explores geographic disparities in childcare pricing to identify the most expensive regions. Findings show that Massachusetts, Connecticut, Washington, Hawaii, and New York have the highest average weekly childcare costs in the country.
